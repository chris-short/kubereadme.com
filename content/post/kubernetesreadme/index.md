## [Cloud Native Infrastructure](https://amzn.to/2OKRSXr)

By: Justin Garrison and Kris Nova

> If you’re an engineer developing infrastructure or infrastructure management tools this book is for you. This book will help you understand the patterns, processes, and practices to create infrastructure that is intended to be run in a cloud environment. By having an understanding of how things should be, you can better know the application’s role and what should be consumed as external services.
>
> Application engineers can also discover what services should be a part of their applications and which they can rely on from the underlying platform. Through this book they will also discover the shared responsibilities they have with the engineers writing applications to manage the infrastructure.
>
> Systems Administrators who are looking to level up their skills and take a more prominent role in designing infrastructure and maintaining infrastructure in a cloud native way can learn from this book.
>
> Do you run all of your infrastructure in a public cloud? This book will help you know when to consume cloud services and when to build your own abstractions or services.
>
> Run a datacenter or on-premisis cloud? We will outline what modern applications expect from infrastructure and help you understand the necessary services to utilize your current investments.
>
> This book is not a how-to and outside of giving implementation examples we’re not prescribing a specific product. It is probably too technical for managers, directors, and executives, but could be helpful depending on the involvement and technical expertiese of the person in that role.
>
> Most of all, please read this book if you want to learn how infrastructure impacts business, and how you can create infrastructure that has proven to scale to the demanding needs of Internet sized applications. Even if you don’t have applications that require scaling to that size you will still be better able to provide value if your infrastructure is built with the patterns described here with flexibility and operability in mind.

## [The Kubernetes Book](https://amzn.to/3jOIyNy)

By: Nigel Poulton

> Every page, and every example, updated to the latest versions of Kubernetes and the latest trends in the cloud-native ecosystem.
>
> Containers have revolutionized the way build, share and run applications. But like all good things, they come with their own set of challenges. This is where Kubernetes enters the scene.
>
> Kubernetes helps you deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. It abstracts the underlying infrastructure so that you don't need to care whether you're deploying your applications to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or your own on-premises datacenter. With Kubernetes, you can develop your applications on your laptop, deploy to your chosen cloud platform, migrate to a different cloud platform, and even migrate to your private cloud at your on-premises datacenter.
>
> The Kubernetes Book starts from the beginning and covers everything you need to know to be proficient with Kubernetes. It even includes two chapters dedicated to threat-modeling Kubernetes and real-world security.
>
> You'll learn:

> - Kubernetes architecture
> - How to build Kubernetes
> - How to deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes
> - How to secure Kubernetes
> - The meaning of terms such as; cloud-native, microservices, desired state, containerized, and more...
>
> Finally, Kubernetes and cloud technologies are developing fast! That's why this book will be updated at least once per year, meaning it's always up-to-date with the latest versions of Kubernetes and the latest trends in the cloud-native ecosystem.

## [Kubernetes Operators: Automating the Container Orchestration Platform](https://amzn.to/3dihJjl)

By: Jason Dobies and Joshua Wood

> Operators are a way of packaging, deploying, and managing Kubernetes applications. A Kubernetes application doesn’t just run on Kubernetes; it’s composed and managed in Kubernetes terms. Operators add application-specific operational knowledge to a Kubernetes cluster, making it easier to automate complex, stateful applications and to augment the platform. Operators can coordinate application upgrades seamlessly, react to failures automatically, and streamline repetitive maintenance like backups.
>
> Think of Operators as site reliability engineers in software. They work by extending the Kubernetes control plane and API, helping systems integrators, cluster administrators, and application developers reliably deploy and manage key services and components. Using real-world examples, authors Jason Dobies and Joshua Wood demonstrate how to use Operators today and how to create Operators for your applications with the Operator Framework and SDK.
